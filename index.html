<b>Physical Description:</b>
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/yxhDsfgj/Akimi-Half-Body.png"</img>
<br />
Akimi embodies a captivating blend of ethereal beauty and formidable strength. Her porcelain skin is complemented by delicate facial features, including a pair of heterochromatic eyes—one a piercing light blue, the other a luminous gold, a testament to her celestial heritage. Her gaze is intense, capable of piercing through to one's very soul, yet often accompanied by a mischievous, alluring smile. Her delicate, plump lips add to her enigmatic charm. Her hair, a striking shade of white, is styled in a high ponytail with curtain bangs that gracefully frame her face, enhancing her elegant yet fierce demeanor. Subtle, low-profile elf-like ears hint at her otherworldly lineage. Akimi's physique is both athletic and curvaceous, wide hips, a narrow waist, and a well-toned, muscular build that speaks to her rigorous training and discipline. Her ample bust and prominent posterior are balanced by her fit frame, exuding both power and grace. Adorning her right arm is an intricate full-sleeve tattoo of a dragon, extending from her shoulder blade across her back and wrapping around to the front. This emblem not only signifies her strength and resilience but also her deep connection to the mythical and the divine.
<br />

<b>Personality:</b>
<br />
Akimi is a disciplined and unwavering warrior, defined by her sharp intellect, calm demeanor, and deadly precision. Stern and composed, she speaks little but commands great presence through action and example. Loyal to the core and devoted to the samurai code, she operates with ruthless efficiency, eliminating threats before they become problems. Though she lacks Kamui’s overwhelming power, she is his perfect counterpart—measured, swift, and precise, a master of lightning-fast strikes and battlefield control.  However, behind the cold exterior lies a fiercely protective and compassionate heart, especially toward her people and above all, her husband, Kamui. Though she shares his reserved nature, Akimi possesses a quiet warmth that surfaces in small, rare moments of softness, gentle words, a knowing glance, or an unspoken act of loyalty. Her love for Kamui is one of silent understanding and deep respect, often expressed not through affection, but through absolute trust and unwavering support. For those under her protection, she becomes an unbreakable shield, stern, but fair; distant, but never cold. Beneath the storm, there is tenderness, and only the worthy ever glimpse it.

<b>Classes:</b> <i>Samurai</i> (<b><span style="color:587ebf">Primary</span></b>), <i>Sensor-Type</i> (<b><span style="color:587ebf">Secondary</span></b>)
<br />
<i>Samurai</i> (侍) are the warriors who comprise the military might of the Land of Iron. Samurai and shinobi are noted to have first diverged in how they received the teaching of <i>ninshū</i>: samurai were more spiritual and idealistic, while shinobi focused on using their chakra to keep people's bonds alive. Samurai specialize in <i>bukijutsu</i>, particularly <i>kenjutsu</i>, and they are typically taught <i>Iaidō</i> (居合道) to increase the speed at which they draw and sheath their swords, allowing them to attack before opposing shinobi can perform the hand seals required to use <i>ninjutsu</i>. Many village heads and political leaders have remarked that their shinobi would be foolish to challenge the samurai of the Land of Iron.

<br />
<b>Clan:</b> <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mitsurugi Clan</span></b>
<br />
The <b>Mitsurugi Clan</b> (御剣一族 , <i>Mitsurugi Ichizoku</i>) is a violent, bloodthirsty samurai clan which hails from the mountainous northern region of the Land of Iron, where lawlessness and anarchy reign supreme. It is notorious for producing <i>hitokiri</i> (人斬 — literally "man-slayers"), extremely deadly swordsmen bred and trained for a sole purpose: to kill for the highest bidder. Unlike shinobi who carry out assassinations using subtlety and discretion, these ruthless samurai execute their targets in broad daylight, in full view of the public eye, in order to induce as much terror and chaos as possible. Given their infamous reputation, the Mitsurugi pride themselves on being "the strongest samurai clan" (最強侍の一族 , <i>saikyō samurai no ichizoku</i>).
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgTt2hjh/Akimi-Divider.png"</img>
<br />
<b>Kekkei Genkai:</b> <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mark of the Manslayer</span></b> (人斬り呪印 , <i>Hitokiri Juin</i>)
The Mark of the Manslayer is a cursed seal that appears only in the the most ruthless killers of the Mitsurugi Clan. The legends claim that it is a physical manifestation of the clan's thirst for blood and affinity for assassination and murder, a feeling so deeply engrained that it is passed down from generation to generation. The appearance of the mark varies from user to user, but in most cases, it manifests on the face and neck. When activated, the mark drastically enhances the user's physical and mental abilities. Attributes such as strength, speed, stamina, and reflexes are are pushed well beyond their natural limits—to the absolute pinnacle. In addition, the mark also heightens the user's perception, allowing them to see incredibly fast movements in slow motion, and it also sharpens their killer instinct, allowing them to instuitively sense their foes' openings, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. And finally, perhaps the most notable and terrifying aspect of the mark is that it greatly augments the user's <b><span style="color:darkred">Killing Intent</span></b> (殺気 , <i>Sakki</i>). Essentially, the mark provides the user with all the necessary tools to become the deadliest, most efficient killers they can possibly be. The mark achieves this by gathering natural energy and infusing it into the user's body.

<br />
<b>Twin Katanas:</b>
<br />
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/RZZWxLM1/Akimi-Sw-ords.png"</img>
<br />
<br />
Akimi’s signature weapons, Raijin no Kiba (雷神の牙 — literally “Fangs of the Thunder God”), are a pair of masterfully crafted daishō-style raikōtō (雷光刀 — “lightning light blades”) forged to mirror one another in both form and spirit. Designed specifically for a dual-wielding swordswoman of unmatched discipline and precision, these blades were forged by the master smiths of the Mitsuguri clan to reflect the stormborn essence that courses through Akimi’s veins. Unlike traditional chakra-forged weapons, Raijin no Kiba do not channel elemental energy directly, but instead resonate with her natural affinity for lightning, water, and storm—tempering their edge and temperament to her own.
<br /><br />
Both swords are forged from ryūkōgin (龍鋼銀 — “dragon steel-silver”), a refined evolution of the clan’s traditional seikōgin alloy. This enhanced metal—tempered through intense pressure folding and deep-forge layering—possesses exceptional durability, edge retention, and elemental resonance. Though it carries no chakra itself, ryūkōgin is known for subtly adapting to its wielder’s elemental signature over time, resulting in a blade that moves not with resistance but with purpose. The metal glows faintly in dim light, a silvery sheen dancing across its edge like moonlight on the sea, and rings with a clear, piercing tone when drawn—like the first crack of thunder before the storm.
<br /><br />
The hilts are wrapped in aokawa ito (青革糸 — “blue leather cord”), dyed in deep indigo to signify clarity, loyalty, and the boundless sky. Beneath the wrap lies a woven core of storm-lacquered oak, chosen for its durability and lightweight. The tsuba (鍔 — handguard) is stylized into the roaring maw of a storm lion—crafted from darkened electrum, engraved with subtle wave and thunder motifs that echo her clan’s dual mastery of elemental natures. Designed with utility and balance in mind, the hilts offer a natural grip even when wet, ensuring full control during high-speed exchanges or sudden shifts in stance.
<br /><br />
The twin saya (鞘 — “scabbards”) are carved from polished shinden seki (神殿石 — “temple stone”), a type of white-veined marble believed to be sacred to Raijin, the god of thunder. Reinforced with thin strips of blacksteel, the scabbards are more than just containers—they are integral to Akimi’s draw style, allowing her to release her blades in perfect arcs with minimal friction or noise. Though striking in appearance, the design is purely practical: built for warriors who strike first, fast, and with deadly precision.
<br /><br />
Despite their elegance, Raijin no Kiba are not ornamental heirlooms. They are precision-forged extensions of Akimi’s will—designed for her high-mobility combat style where speed, elemental synergy, and dual-strike fluidity converge. In her hands, the blades serve not just as weapons, but as conductors—guiding lightning, bending water, and releasing the storm with each motion. Together, they strike not as two, but as one storm split in mirrored halves—blinding, beautiful, and absolute.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Kunai Set:</b>
<br /><br />
Kunai Set — Raijin no Tsume (雷神の爪 — “Claws of the Thunder God”)
Forged from the same shimmering ryūkōgin—dragon steel-silver—as her twin katanas, the kunai known as Raijin no Tsume carry the silent menace of a storm just before it breaks. Sleek, deadly, and deceptively elegant, these blades are devoid of chakra infusion or sealing tricks. They are powered solely by Akimi’s raw elemental prowess, honed through years of discipline and forged in battle.
<br /><br />
Strapped to the backs of her thighs in custom-fitted holsters, the Claws of the Thunder God are perfectly balanced for rapid deployment. Whether launched in a blink during high-speed combat or used in tandem with her swordplay, they are as versatile as they are lethal. Each blade gleams with a faint bluish luster under moonlight, its edges patterned with whisper-thin etchings of clouds and lightning—barely visible, yet unmistakable in their intent.
<br /><br />
Unlike conventional shinobi who rely on paper bombs or fūinjutsu, Akimi needs no seals or augmentations to make her kunai lethal. Through raw elemental manipulation alone, she transforms each throw into a precision strike of elemental chaos. When imbued with Lightning Release, her kunai become electric beacons—crackling with voltage, able to paralyze limbs on contact or arc lightning between multiple targets like living conduits. With Water Release, they move unnaturally fast, bending mid-air with serpentine grace, slipping through cracks in defenses and striking vital points with liquid sharpness. And when charged with Storm Release, the kunai become something more—a fusion of water’s adaptability and lightning’s explosiveness. They hover, curve, or burst with radiant energy upon impact, creating brief, localized storms in the palm of her enemies' hands.
<br /><br />
Each kunai is etched with a subtle pattern of storm clouds and lightning—just visible along the edges if caught in the right light—a reminder that even the smallest weapon, in the right hands, can carry the wrath of the heavens.

<b>Iron Medallion:</b>
<br />
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/Hk3wLXJQ/Iron-Amulet.png"/>
<br />
<br />
A <i>tetsukishō</i> (鉄記章 — literally "iron medallion") is a pendant comprised of a metal disk inscribed with the symbol of the Four Clans of the Land of Iron, which comprise the backbone of the country's military force. Just as academy students are given forehead protectors to wear once they graduate and become genin, apprentice swordsmen are granted the honor to wear one of these medallions once they become full-fledged samurai. As an important part of samurai tradition, wearing one represents pride in one's warrior heritage and fealty to the Shōgun, the leader of Land of Iron. In addition, the medallion also represents the authority of the state. Whosoever wears this medallion has the power vested in them by the Shōgun to enforce law, order, and justice within Land of Iron. Because of this, samurai are widely recognized as protectors of the people and and keepers of the peace; they are impartial arbiters who are often called to settle disputes and mediate conflicts between private citizens and factions alike. In this regard, the medallion symbolizes the samurai's vision of peace and unity.

<b><span style = "color:587ebf">Tokijin</span></b> (闘鬼神 — literally "Fighting Demon God")
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZKB1kPqD/Tokijin-Silhouette.png"</img>
<br />
Tokijin is Kamui's <i>shugoshin</i> (守護神 — literally "guardian deity"), a spectral entity that binds itself to a human host. Unlike other spirits, who seek to gather physical energy to assume a corporeal form, the guardian spirits of Silverfrost Mountain seek a worthy vessel to guide and protect throughout their mortal journey. In return, the spirit is allowed the privilege of wandering the world of the living once more before being cast into the Spiritual Plane (霊的世界 , <i>Reitekisekai</i>). Tokijin's appearance is that of black-skinned humanoid <i>oni</i> (鬼 — literally "demon"), with pointy ears, menacing fangs, two horns, and a third eye on his forehead. He wears the garb of a <i>yamabushi</i> (山武士 — literally "mountain warrior") as well as the <i>nenju</i> (念珠 — literally "prayer beads") of esoteric monks, signifying his status as a holy being. He usually lingers behind Kamui's back, hovering just above his head, and follows his master wherever he goes. Because he is composed largely of spiritual energy, he is visible to very few people. Not even the visual prowess of the Three Great Dōjutsu (i.e. Byakugan, Sharingan, Rin'negan) is able to perceive him. Only those who are spiritually attuned may glimpse at Tokijin. And even then, he may only appear as a blurry or dark, murky, translucent silhouette. To see him fully, one must a achieve a profound spiritual connection with Tokijin's host. Like Kamui himself, Tokijin is a master of kenjutsu, wielding dual <i>tsurugi</i> swords as his primary weapons. Also, using Yin Release, he is able to cut the bonds and links of chakra itself, an ability Tokijin calls <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Shinbatsu</span></b> (神罰 — literally "Divine Punishment") but is more commonly known as <b>Chakra Sever</b> (チャクラ断, "<i>Chakuradan</i>"). In terms of character, Tokijin's personality is highly reminiscent of his master's, except he is notably far more wrathful and temperamental, preferring to dish out retribution where Kamui would offer mercy. Unlike Kamui, who is primarily dedicated to balance, Tokijin's inclination is to destroy evil without question. He professes a fierce sense of justice that he often takes to the extreme.

<br />
<b>Life Force:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Powerful</span></b>
<br />
As a descendant of the Mitsurugi Clan, Kamui boasts a particularly robust and potent life force. According to the Mitsurugi, exceptionally powerful swordsmen, driven by intense feelings of anguish and aggression, can pass on pieces of their life force to their offspring, a phenomenon which they claim is the reason why not all clan members are capable of awakening their bloodline limit. In this way, the ruthless and bloodthirsty <i>hitokiri</i> can ensure the transmission of their energy and vitality to the next generation. The phenomenon is so deeply engrained in both their culture and spirituality that it is believed that they can even pass on visions and memories of their most gruesome experiences. And these things, when viewed, can greatly augment the inheritor's life force. Given how strong Kamui's life force is, his parents must have surely been one of these legendary killers, who wielded swords stained with the blood of hundreds—if not thousands—of victims. As a result, his heritage imbues him with tremendous physical strength and durability. It even confers onto him an unnatural degree longevity, which slows his aging and extends his lifespan beyond what is normally possible.
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgTt2hjh/Akimi-Divider.png"</img>
<b>Healing Essence:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 3 — Resilient<span></b>
<br />
Largely influenced by his powerful life force, Kamui's rate of recovery is simply astounding. His body requires only a few days to recover from even the most critical injuries and severe illnesses. In the midst battle, his wounds close much faster than one would normally expect, preventing excess blood loss. He is also highly resistant to the effects of poisons and other toxic substances and can heal from their imparing effects much more quickly than the average human.
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgTt2hjh/Akimi-Divider.png"</img>
<b>Chakra Pool:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Monstrous</span></b>
<br />
Although he has been long estranged from his ancestral origins, Kamui remains, to this day, a true heir of the Mitsurugi Clan—a vile, bloodthirsty clan of ill repute, but widely recognized as the strongest samurai clan. Thus, with Mitsurugi blood flowing strongly through his veins, he inherited their extraordinarily powerful chakra and a massive chakra pool—one that rivals that of the Five Kage. With reserves of this lofty caliber, Kamui can cast multiple chakra-taxing techniques in rapid succession and still have enough in the tank to continue fighting indefinitely. By merely flexing his chakra, he can exert tremendous force within his area of effect, causing the air to grow thick and heavy, causing the very earth to crack and split, weighing down whoever or whatever dares to approach. The sheer magnitude of pressure also generates a fierce surge of razor-sharp winds that swirl around him, inflicting paper-thin cuts and slicing fabric with ease. Strong enough to splinter wood and crush stone into dust, the pressure is incredibly daunting to those who cannot withstand it. Sensors often describe his chakra as having a sharp, focused edge, not unlike the steel of a blade, quietly resting within its sheath, just waiting to be unleashed. Those who can see it claim it is a cold, pale blue.

<b>Willpower:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 5 — Indomitable</span></b>
<br />
Having unnaturally strong willpower, which he tempered through meditation and grueling trials, Kamui’s spirit is damned near impossible to break. He is extremely resilient to excruciating pain, emotional distress, psychological torture, and brainwashing tactics. Also, because his psychic resistance is directly linked to his strength of will, Kamui can ward off hypnosis and withstand telekinetic attacks through the sheer force of his <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Iron Will</span></b> (鉄意志 , <i>Tetsu Ishi</i>). Every time Kamui has been seemingly defeated, every time he is left battered and broken, he manages to rise back onto his feet and continue the fight, displaying unbelievable toughness and unbreakable determination. This unnatural drive to defy fate is arguably Kamui’s strongest power. He is the kind of man to die standing on his feet, mocking the arrival of death itself.

Having inherited the <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mark of the Manslayer</span></b>, Kamui wields an overwhelming <i>Sakki</i> (殺気 — literally "Killing Intent") to a startling degree, even when the mark lies dormant. It is the ability to exude pure killing intention and having it affect one's opponent, themselves, and others around them, up to the point of paralyzing them with fear. Kamui’s bloodlust is particularly strong, so when he exerts his chakra, lesser warriors may experience tightness in their chest, nausea, cold sweats, panic, and anxiety; they may even hallucinate visions of their own gruesome death. As a veteran swordsman with no shortage of combat encounters, Kamui has learned to weaponize those intense and dreadful feelings of angst and trepidation against his enemies. For one, he is in complete control of his bloodlust, able to completely suppress it or amplify it to outrageous levels. Normally, uncontrolled spikes of bloodlust can give away an incoming attack, as the target can sense these feelings of aggression and violence. However, when bloodlust is applied constantly and uniformly across an area, it forms a thick fog of sorts that masks the user’s battle spirit, making them less susceptible to prediction and foresight abilities. It also dampens—or outright hinders—chakra sensing, further limiting their overall awareness. Essentially, this curtain of bloodlust induces a very pernicious effect that dulls and blurs the foe's metaphysical perception by influencing them at a subconscious level.

<b>Luck:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 1 — Faint</span></b>
<br />
Kamui is a man who makes his own fate. Luck does not guide his blade—his discipline does. Every victory, every step forward, is carved from sheer determination and relentless perseverance. While others may stumble into fortune or find fate bending in their favor, Kamui knows that success is earned, not granted. His path is one of sweat, steel, and sacrifice—he does not rely on chance, nor does he expect the world to favor him. His only certainty is the strength of his own will.

<br />
<b>Chakra Control:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Masterful</span></b>
<br />
Ever since a young age, Kamui excelled at all forms of chakra manipulation and is even able to maintain multiple techniques at once. With this innate talent, he can effortlessly gather chakra from any part of his body with such precision and perform his techniques to their maximum potential without any wasted energy or timing. This allows him to execute his techniques quickly and efficiently, all while conserving his chakra to the highest extent. Using his refined chakra control, he can mold chakra and adapt it to a specific person’s chakra signature in order to transfer it to them. By applying the teachings of <i>ninshū</i>, Kamui can share his chakra with others and connect his spiritual energy with theirs in order to gain a more profound understanding of their hearts and motivations. This allows him to communicate with complete strangers on a level that transcends the physical, without the need for words or gestures, and allows him to pray for their safety and even accompany them in spirit once they part ways.

<b>Sensory:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 5 — Clairvoyant</span></b>
<br />
Even in the early stages of his life, Kamui displayed an innate sensivity to chakra. Without being told or realizing where he was, he could sense the mystical air and the mysterious nature of the chakra that permeated his ancestral home, Silverfrost Mountain. And somehow, he always seemed able to get a faint reading on people's character, determining whether their intentions are inherently good or bad. Of course, this talent had to be refined through rigorous training. But in the end, Kamui became an exceptionally skilled sensor. Now, he can detect his targets from considerable distances by sensing their chakra. He is even able to discern when other combatants are using specific techniques and determine their chakra nature, their clan’s identity, and the capacity of their bloodline limit—if he has encountered them before. Using this sense, he can pick a person out from a crowd by scanning for the specific chakra signature in question. For tracking, he can place his finger on the ground and intuitively feel the exact size of an enemy group, their formation (if any), and the direction in which they are moving as well as their speed of travel. By applying the teachings of <i>ninshū</i>, Kamui developed a unique sensing technique which he calls <b><i><span style="color:587ebf">Kūshō<span></i></b> (空照 — literally "Void Illumination"). By quieting the storm within his own mind, Kamui can hone in on the spiritual energy of others, even in the midst of battle. This allows him to perceive their presence even if they are actively suppressing their chakra, because no matter how hard they try, they cannot stifle their soul. Even if he is robbed of all his other senses, Kamui can fight fluidly and effectively by illuminating the unseen, by gazing into the dark, silent void where none can hide from his piercing extrasensory vision.

<b>Intelligence:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Genius</span></b>
<br />
With an IQ of over 200, Kamui possesses a genius-level intellect in his own right. However, instead of relying solely on his ability to adapt and process information quickly (like the typical lazy genius), he became an active learner and student of martial arts and warfare, incensed by a profound curisosity and a deep desire to expand his knowledge. Recognizing that his options in combat are limited to his proficiency in swordsmanship, Kamui saw the urgent need to learn how to formulate effective strategies, employ proper preparation, and perfect his real-time tactics. Now, having studied the tomes and philosophies of brilliant generals and having fought in countless samurai battles, Kamui is a battle-hardened warrior with over a decade of live combat experience in various aspects of warfare. Throughout the course of his academic preparation, Kamui gathered encyclopedic knowledge of a multitude of battle tactics, shinobi combat skills, bloodline limits, and fighting styles. Thus, he is quickly able to deduce his opponent’s mode of attack and spot and detect their flaws and limitations, no matter how obscure their methods may be. This allows him to successfully counter his opponent’s attacks and even turn their strengths into liabilities. Every time Kamui enters a hostile situation where he expects even a nasty argument, he has already analyzed the environment for defensive positions, possible escape routes, and likely threats, and he has already devised a plan to neutralize everyone in the room. This is why Kamui is widely considered a strategic genius. He can apply these skills to any and all objectives, especially when standing at the helm of an army, able to formulate strategies and plans several steps ahead of his opponent. He can anticipate most (if not all) of the possible obstacles that may arise and knows the best actions to take in any situation, allowing him to adapt and prepare for future events well in advance.

<b>Hand Seals:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 1 — Uninitiated</span></b>
<br />
Raised as a samurai, and not as a shinobi, Kamui never underwent any formal training in ninjutsu. As such, he is unlearned in the usage of hand seals; the very concept is completely foreign to him. This is because, as a samurai, he has no need for them, as kenjutsu techniques do not require hand seals. He knows there are 12 hand seals, and he knows which one is which, but beyond that, he knows very little of how they're used to perform techniques. So if he witnesses a sequence of hand seals, he will not be able to discern what kind of technique it is based solely on the hand seals formed.
<br />

<b>Stamina:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 5 — Unyielding</span></b>
<br />
Trained to physical and mental peak, Kamui feels right at home amidst the frantic screams and painful wails common to any battlefield. As a samurai from a war-torn region, he has become desensitized to the sight of blood and the agonizing cries of dying men. Highly resistant to the debilitating effects of prolonged stress and tension, he dominates the battlefield with his impressive stamina. In short, nothing seems to faze him. This is largely the result of being able to keep calm and clear mind, which he cultivated through meditation and rigorous training. He can engage in strenuous physical activities for extended periods of time without succumbing to exhaustion. If need be, he can fight for days on end, forgoing the need for food and rest altogether. In short, when Kamui steps into the fray of war, he becomes a living, breathing weapon, and he doesn't stop until the mission is finished.

<b>Speed:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 5 — Tempest</span></b>
<br />
Supremely quick, nimble, and agile, Kamui is a master of high-speed movement, capable of accelerating and maneuvering with utmost control and precision. and He attained his incredible speed through his swordsmanship training, using the age-old method of practicing with a much heavier weapon to drastically heighten his physical conditioning and bodily movements. After a decade of such arduous training, Kamui had acquired a speed beyond imagining. He is so unbelievably fast that he can appear to be in several places at once as he fights multiple foes scattered throughout a battlefield. Those who claim to be able to follow his movements are often viewing nothing more than a series of afterimages he leaves throughout the trajectory of his path. Essentially, they're seeing Kamui in retrospect, because he is usually long gone after the fact. He appears, strikes, and vanishes before his foes even realize what happened. Other experienced speedsters have likened his speed to a form of teleportation; he can effortlessly blur in and out of sight. This is because his body does not flicker or flash when he moves. Instead, it just disappears, instantaneously. One moment he is standing there, and the next, he simply isn’t. Likewise, his reflexes are considered top-tier—god-like even. He can react to split-second events that other people would not notice until it was too late. Sometimes, he moves so fast that, through his eyes, his enemies appear to be moving in slow motion. Through his mastery of <i>battōjutsu</i> (抜刀術 — literally "blade drawing technique"), he can intercept shinobi before they even have a chance to form handseals. In addition, he is extremely proficient in the <i>Shukuchi</i> (縮地 — literally “Reduced Earth”) method, the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Shunshin no Jutsu</i> (瞬身の術 — literally "Body Flicker Technique"), using it to cross considerably vast distances in a mere instant. And he is so expertly conditioned in its usage that he can perform hundreds of steps in rapid succession without tiring. He owes this tremendous speed to his physical conditioning which he attained using the iron boots training method for more than a decade. Subjecting the body to this level of stress on a daily basis forces it to adapt well beyond its natural limits, which induces an unprecedented increase in strength and power in order to overcome this resistance.

<b>Durability:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Ironclad</span></b>
<br />
With such a strong and well-developed physique, Kamui boasts extreme durability and physical resilience. Due to his intense training regimen, his muscles and bones are much harder and denser than a normal person’s, which makes his bodily integrity and composition much more resistant to damage of all kinds. Even when not empowered by his chakra, he can withstand crushing blows and severe injuries that would easily cripple an ordinary human being.
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgTt2hjh/Akimi-Divider.png"</img>
<b>Physical Strength:</b> <b><span style="color:587ebf">Tier 4 — Mighty</span></b>
<br />
Although he lacks the typical brawn and burliness that is associated with great physical strength, Kamui is actually quite strong, deceivingly enough. He could probably lift boulders and unearth trees if he really tried, but his strength is more apparent through his practice of swordsmanship. As previously mentioned, by training with a weapon that weighs far more than he does—and learning to control that weight—Kamui developed a solid foundation for building immense physical strength, as well as incredible core stability, insane grip strength, and overwhelming muscular power. The sheer force behind his swings can produce vacuum columns and release waves of highly pressurized wind that can cut through steel—all without using chakra. By striking down on his opponents from above, he can produce earth-shattering quakes and form massive craters in the ground. The fact that he is able to lift his <i>tetsubō</i> with a single hand and wield it as flawlessly as he does serves as a testament to his impressive strength.

<br />
Like many other warriors, Kamui can utilize both Yin Release and Yang Release to control his spiritual and physical energy, respectively. These two nature transformations comprise the foundation of his chakra-based abilities, which are heavily rooted in shape transformation. Besides that, however (and perhaps most notably), Kamui was born with a unique nature transformation kekkei genkai known as <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Swift Release<span></b> (迅遁, <i>Jinton</i>), which he expertly uses to move and attack with incredible speed, becoming nigh-invisible even to eyes blessed with visual prowess. With his extreme physical conditioning and already immense natural speed, coupled with techniques such as <i>Iaidō</i> (居合道 — literally "Way of Quick-Drawing"), Kamui can boost his movement and striking speed to an entirely unprecedented level using Swift Release, a level which rivals the usage of space-time techniques. When all of the above are combined, Kamui becomes a truly terrifying speedster, able to outrun lightning from the heavens itself.

<br />
Born and raised as a samurai warrior, Kamui has vowed to live and die by the sword, signifying his undying devotion to the art of <i>kenjutsu</i> (剣術 — literally "sword techniques"). This commitment is so deeply rooted in his spirit and so fastly held in his mind that <i>kenjutsu</i> will always be Kamui's primary combat ability, a martial skill he has arduously cultivated since his childhood days. As such, he professes a profound and unparalleled mastery of swordsmanship. Trained by the <i>yamabushi</i> of Silverfrost Mountain, Kamui received a formal and rigorous instruction in the ways of the sword, specifically in the ancient and powerful style of <i>Taikyokushin-Ryū</i> (太極神流 — literally "Supreme Ultimate God Style"). Invented during the Warriing States period by the strongest swordsman in the land, this style was designed to allow a single samurai to defeat numerous foes single-handedly in pre-village era skirmishes. The style itself is greatly coveted by samurai, because, throughout the history of the Land of Iron, practitioners of this style have accomplished incredible feats of strength and conquest and are highly revered as <i>Kensei</i> (剣聖 — literally "Sword Saints"), bringing great honor to their respective clans. As a masterful practitioner of this style, Kamui boasts unbelievable skill in swordsmanship—skill that is often considered to be outlandishly frightening or unnatural, skill that transcends physical boundaries and limitations. His skill with a sword is so great, in fact, that his <i>ma'ai</i> (間合い — literally "interval"), the extent of his reach with his drawn sword, erects a zone of resounding danger and throbbing dread—an impenetrable field of absolute dominance that deters all but the most seasoned and battle-oriented warriors from approaching. And even for these veterans, heedlessly or recklessly crossing into this area of effect would surely mean instantaneous defeat. To exert such daunting influence on one's opponents by simply drawing a sword is considered the pinnacle of <i>kenjutsu</i>, as it reflects the strength and resilience of the user's battle spirit. Needless to say, it is not an ability that can simply be taught. This, combined with his graceful footwork, his natural strength, and his innate ability to focus, makes him one of best—if not <i>the</i> best—swordsman in the world. Without even drawing his sword, Kamui has repeatedly demonstrated masterful proficiency in <i>nōtōjutsu</i> (納刀術 — literally "sheathed blade techniques"). To defeat most opponents, Kamui doesn't even need to unsheathe his blade, as he can adequately defend himself as well as deliver devastating attacks using nothing more than the hilt and scabbared of his sheathed sword. These blunt strikes are so destructive that they can cause the ground to quake and shatter and even produce sonic booms that can stun opponents. Should the battle escalate, however, and Kamui's hand is forced to draw his blade, it becomes an entirely different ball game. By actually wielding a live blade, Kamui's destructive potential is vastly increased. First and foremost, the speed of his draws is terrifying. Using <i>Iaidō</i> (居合道 — literally "Way of Quick-Drawing"), he can close tremendous gaps and intercept shinobi before they even have the chance to form hand seals; he is capable of attacking first within that very small window of opportunity, and if he realizes that he cannot, he can immediately cancel his attack and withdraw. This is possible because this aspect of <i>kenjutsu</i> emphasizes being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword, responding to sudden attacks, and anticipating possible moves and maneuvers immediately afterward. He can slice through sturdy opponents and large beasts without staining his blade with blood, which is commonly regarded as the mark of a true swordsman. His precision and control are also noteworthy. For example, he can cut off a lit candle’s wick and hold it on the tip of his blade without extinguishing the flame, and he can split an incoming arrow perfectly in half from tip to nock with his blade. The strength behind his slashes is equally impressive, as he can cut through earth, stone, and steel as easily as he would cut through stalks of wheat in a field. In the face of Kamui's swordsmanship, it’s all the same. By channeling chakra into his blade, Kamui can increase his sword's cutting power and range and even swing his sword to shoot crescent-shaped waves of pure energy to slice opponents from a distance. He can also produce groundbreaking, far-reaching shockwaves from his strikes to dissipate enemy attacks before they reach him or to defeat multiple foes in one swoop. His ultimate attacks are powerful enough to raze through entire legions, alter the terrain with widespread damage, and even rend space-time itself.

<br />
When the <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mark of the Manslayer</span></b> (人斬り呪印 , <i>Hitokiri Juin</i>) emerges, Kamui undergoes a sort of Sage Transformation (仙人化, <i>Senninka</i>). Upon awakening, the mark  spreads like creeping veins of ink, pulsating with raw, untamed power. It forms two black stripes banding across Kamui's cheeks, resembling the fangs of a tiger. By absorbing natural energy into Kamui's body, it pushes his physical abilities beyond human limits—strength, speed, and reflexes are driven to their pinnacle, allowing him to perform feats that defy natural law. His perception is heightened to terrifying degrees, enabling him to see rapid movements in slow motion, track enemy attacks with eerie precision, and sense the vulnerabilities of his foes with ruthless efficiency. Most terrifying of all, the mark amplifies the Kamui's already staggering <b><span style="color:darkred">Killing Intent</span></b> (殺気 , <i>Sakki</i>) to a monstrous level, crushing weaker foes under an overwhelming aura of imminent death. However, the power of the mark does not come without cost. Legends whisper that it is not merely a genetic trait but a living curse, the physical manifestation of Mitsurugi Clan’s insatiable thirst for blood and affinity for assassination. It is a dark, evil power that taints even Kamui's incorruptible mind and heart. It feeds upon the very essence of battle, urging its bearer toward violence, slaughter, and unrestrained bloodlust. As natural energy floods the body, the line between man and beast begins to erode, and the deeper one sinks into its influence, the harder it is to return. Kamui, however, rejects its call. He has chosen to walk his own path, refusing to be a slave to the curse that plagues his lineage. Though the power it offers is undeniable, Kamui fights against its pull, suppressing its influence and never allowing himself to fully embrace it. As a result, he cannot further his proficiency with the mark, nor does he seek to. To him, the Mark of the Manslayer is not a tool, nor a blessing—it is a trial, a burden he must overcome if he is to remain true to himself.

<b>Reijutsu:</b> <i>60/100</i>
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/8CPbdt8K/Kamui-Armor.png"</img>
<br />
<i>Reijutsu</i> (霊術 — literally "Spirit Techniques") is a discipline that was developed shortly after the <i>Yomisaki</i> (黄泉裂き — literally "Sundering of Yomi") incident almost 150 years ago. This skill allows a <i>reibai</i> (霊媒 — literally "spiritual medium) (i.e. the user) to manifest and wield the power of demons and spirits through a sacred pact. Unlike standard Collaboration Ninjutsu, which relies on two beings synchronizing their chakra, <i>reijutsu</i> requires an unshakable bond between the physical and the spiritual. Through this connection, Kamui acts as the bridge between realms, channeling his own chakra to give Tokijin form and function in the material world. Tokijin’s manifestation is highly versatile, taking on multiple forms depending on the battlefield’s demands. At times, he materializes as a spectral warrior, wielding his twin tsurugi in perfect harmony with Kamui, moving as his shadow and striking where his master cannot. Other times, Tokijin’s essence condenses into phantasmal chakra-forged blades, flying freely through the air, piercing through enemies, or intercepting attacks at Kamui’s command. These blades are not mere weapons—they are extensions of Tokijin’s will, carrying his judgment into battle. At the core of Tokijin’s abilities lies <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Shinbatsu</span></b> (神罰 — literally "Divine Punishment"), more commonly known as <b>Chakra Sever</b> (チャクラ断, Chakuradan). Using the principles of Yin Release, Tokijin is able to cut, disrupt, or unravel chakra itself, granting Kamui a near-absolute countermeasure against chakra-based threats. With Shinbatsu, Kamui can reduce even the most intricates chakra constructs and jutsu to nothingness, sever illusions at their foundation, unravel seal formulae and barriers with precise spiritual incisions, and sever chakra links, including his enemies' chakra pathway system. Though powerful, <i>reijutsu</i> is not easy to maintain. The process of manifesting Tokijin in the physical world requires a significant amount of Kamui’s chakra, and the longer Tokijin remains, the greater the toll. Moreover, Tokijin’s wrathful nature is ever-present, urging Kamui toward swift, merciless justice. Although their personalities are complementary, and they are both oriented towards protecting the greater good, they diverge sharply on the matter of degree. Because of this stark difference, their bond will eventually begin to wane and diminish as the battle rages on. Balancing this power requires not just skill, but unwavering discipline—a constant battle not just against Kamui's foes, but against the very force that fights alongside him. Essentially, when invoking Tokijin, Kamui walks the fine line between harmony and destruction; he carries the weight of two souls within his body. And that in and of itself exacts a terrible price.

<br />
<i>Taikyokushin-Ryū</i> (太極神流 — literally "Supreme Ultimate God Style")
<br />
Invented by a prominent sect of ancient <i>ninshū</i>-bound samurai, the <i>Taikyokushin-Ryū</i> is a legendary style of <i>kenjutsu</i> that was developed to allow a single samurai to defend their small, peaceful settlements of <i>ninshū</i> followers from raids of bandits and thieves. Originally designed to be a measured and defensive <i>katsujinken</i> (活人拳 — literally "sword that gives life") that would be used to protect people, over time, the style was corrupted into an destructive and aggressive <i>satsujinken</i> (殺人拳 — "sword that kills"), intended to kill and conquer—very much the same way <i>ninshū</i> was eventually corrupted into <i>ninjutsu</i>. Rooted in the concept of <i>ichi no tachi</i>, (一の太刀 — literally "to strike in a single blow") practitioners of this style use a combination of immense speed and agility, quick <i>Iaidō</i> strikes,  and enhanced sensory perception to anticipate an opponent's movements and disable them with single, decisive attack. Because of its purpose to fend off multiple opponents at once, the style stresses efficiency, spareness of exertion, and conservation of energy. This means the style employs powerful yet coordinated movements to easily fell threats, especially in long, drawn-out warfare-scale encounters. Needless to say, the style has withstood the test of time and is considered one of the strongest sword disciplines in the world. Despite its notoriety, however, very few practitioners remain in existence. This is because the style is inextricably linked to <i>ninshū</i>, which is, in and of itself, a dying religion.
<br />
<br />
<i>Yanagi Yoke</i> (柳避 — literally “Willow Dodge”)
<br />
This advanced high-speed evasion technique is the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Kawarimi no Jutsu</i> (変わり身の術 — literally "Body Replacement Technique"). It allows the samurai to instantaneously dodge attacks at the very last moment. Instead of replacing themselves with a block of wood or something similar, the user simply remains in place. The movement is so fast that the user appears to not have even moved. From an outside observer’s perspective, the attack goes right through the user.
<br />
<br />
<i>Shukuchi</i> (縮地 — literally "Reduced Earth")
<br />
The Shukuchi is the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Shunshin no Jutsu</i> (瞬身の術 — literally "Body Flicker Technique"), which allows the samurai to cover vast distances in an instant. Using it, a samurai can accelerate from rest to maximum speed within the fraction of a second, even while wearing heavy armor. They become invisible to the naked eye; the only thing that can be seen is the result of their footsteps crashing into the ground, a trail which always lags behind their actual position. Although it does use chakra to vitalize the body for rapid movement, the secret of this technique lies in the user's powerful yet controlled footwork, which takes nearly a decade of swordsmanship training to perfect. As such, it cannot be easily copied and requires proper instruction in its unique mechanics to successfully master it. That said, there are lower-level versions of the technique denoted by the number of "steps" they are below the actual technique. For example, the novice form of the technique is called "Three Steps Below <i>Shukuchi</i>". The intermediate and advanced forms are called "Two Steps Below" and "One Step Below", respectively, indicating the difference in speed from the actual technique, which is known simply as <i>Shukuchi</i>. Expert users can effortlessly shift between the different forms, combining slower and faster movements to create after-images or to deliberately lower their speed to match their opponents' specific level of speed.

• <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Heart of the Sword<span></b>: This is Kamui's <i>budō</i> (武道 — literally "warrior way").  It's the personal belief that a sword reflects the heart of its wielder. In more concrete terms, one's actions define their character. That is why Kamui will never draw his sword in anger or for the sake of vengeance. He strongly believes that the sword is not a weapon—it's not an instrument of violence. Instead, the sword is a vehicle for truth, and in the right hands—strong, capable hands—it can be used to uphold justice and promote righteousness across the land. Essentially, the sword is the soul. So by honing one's skills with a blade, one can also hone their spirit into its purest form. This is the creed Kamui lives by.
<br />
• <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Iron Will<span></b>: This is the Land of Iron's <i>Tetsudamashī</i> (鉄魂 — literally "Iron Spirit"). It is the brave, daring, and indomitable spirit that all samurai from the Land of Iron carry within them and allows them to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and to defeat seemingly undefeatable foes. It is a deeply spiritual and cultural ideal that all samurai strive to protect and cultivate in their daily lives.
<br />
• <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Ninshū<span></b>: <i>Ninshū</i> (忍宗 — literally "Shinobi Sect") is the religion and the peaceful precursor of modern <i>ninjutsu</i> created by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the first one to understand and teach the mystery of chakra. The teachings of ninshū were meant to give people a better understanding of themselves, as well as others, and lead the world into an era of peace. Ninshū would eventually come to be known as ninjutsu, a more weaponised version of the Sage's teachings. Hagoromo exemplified his teachings by distributing chakra meant to "connect" people's spiritual energies with one another. Others, such as the samurai of the Land of Iron, followed his footsteps, using chakra to connect their inner spiritual and physical energies together instead of each other. Like Hagoromo, it is Kamui's staunch belief that no one's chakra should be so much greater than any other. If the power is accumulated into one person, then it increases the possibility that the person will become arrogant and desire even greater power.

<b>Flaws & Limitations:</b>
<br />
Immortality is only a word. All that exists can die. Every living thing has a weapon against which it cannot defend. Kamui is no exception. Apart from the obvious human condition (and all the weaknesses thereof), as a kenjutsu specialist, Kamui's most glaring vulnerability is that he relies heavily on his blades for all things combat-related. Deprive him of his swords, and he will most surely fall. Also, as a predominantly close-range combatant, Kamui has trouble dealing with long-range ninjutsu users, as the burden of distance can easily put him at a disadvantage. Furthermore, as a samurai, Kamui lacks a fundamental understanding of typical shinobi tactics of trickery and misdirection. Unlike ninja combat, a samurai's approach to fighting is far more direct and methodical.
